# gav

A Leiningen plugin to print the maven group/artifact id and version.

I've needed to grab these a few times for build-scripts, jenkins jobs,
etc. It's always fiddly so I thought I'd write a short plugin to do it.

## Usage

Put `[lein-gav "1.0.0"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

### Default output:

group-id
artefact-id
version 

    $ lein gav
    com.example
    myproject
    0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

Specifying the format:

    $ lein gav "** {g} **\n-- {a} --\n__ {v} __"
    ** com.example **
    -- myproject --
    __ 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT __

Slash-separated group-id might be useful for making things which are
shaped like maven repositories:

    $ mkdir -p $(lein gav 'gs')

created the dirs com and com/example.
